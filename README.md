# Redmine project from task plugin

## About project
The Plugin is used for registration of projects and tasks. One main project has been created to register sub - projects and tasks, which contains 3 sub - projects: ideas phase, project initiation phase, execution projects phase. At the project initiation phase, we register projects as tasks. Once the task in the initiation phase is approved, then a sub - project needs to be created in the execution projects phase. To avoid re-submitting information when registering a project, we need a plugin that would allow us to automatically make a sub-project in the execution projects phase from the task in the initiation phase when the task status is changed.
